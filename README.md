This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.1.

## Before You Begin
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/).
* Angular - Angular's [Official Website](http://angular.io) is a great starting point.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/).
* Memcached - Start by going through [Memcached Official Website](http://memcached.org/).

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.

## Quick Install

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Run `ng serve` for a angular. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```bash
$ ng serve
```

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
